      <h2 id="myrows">About me</h2>
        <p class="column2">I'm a native northwesterner with an interest in programming, music, and the outdoors. I was born in Tacoma washington and lived there until I was about 15 years old. My family then moved to the small town of The Dalles, Oregon, where I lived for quite a while. I've lived a year in Las Vegas, NV and a year in the Oregon coastal town of Coos Bay. I <em>love</em> fishing and finding new fishing spots. I'm a big fan of <span <a href="http://www.fs.usda.gov/giffordpinchot/">camping in quiet and forested</a></span> parts of the NW. Every once in a while i can be convinced to scale a mountain. I can play violin classically but prefer jamming out with bands to with styles anywhere from folk, bluegrass, & americana to funk and jazz. I am currently a cashier at Fred Meyer on 20th and Burnside. I was introduced to programming in high school but soft of forgot about it for a while. A friend reccomended me to the Treehouse wesite online and became interested again. I applied to the programming school <strong>Epicodus</strong>, and here I am. Hopefully this is the beginning of a long and fruitful future in programming and web development.</p>
